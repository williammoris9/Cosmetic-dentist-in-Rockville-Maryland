    <h2>What Is Cosmetic Dentistry?</h2>
    <p>Cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the <strong>appearance</strong> of your teeth, gums, and overall smile.

    <ul>
        <li>Stained or discolored teeth</li>
        <li>Crooked or misaligned teeth</li>
        <li>Chipped, cracked, or uneven teeth</li>
        <li>Gaps between teeth</li>
        <li>Missing teeth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Top Cosmetic Dental Services in Rockville</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Crown Dental Care Rockville</strong>, we offer a wide range of cosmetic dentistry procedures to help you achieve the smile you’ve always wanted:</p>

    <h3>✨ Teeth Whitening</h3>
    <p>Professional teeth whitening is one of the fastest ways to brighten your smile. Unlike over-the-counter products, professional whitening delivers dramatic results in fewer sessions — safely and effectively.</p>

    <h3>✨ Porcelain Veneers</h3>
    <p>Veneers are thin, custom-made shells that cover the front surface of teeth to correct imperfections like chips, stains, and gaps. They provide a durable and natural-looking smile makeover.</p>

    <h3>✨ Dental Bonding</h3>
    <p>Dental bonding is a quick, non-invasive solution for minor cosmetic flaws. Tooth-colored resin is applied and shaped to enhance the appearance of your teeth.</p>

    <h3>✨ Invisalign® & Clear Aligners</h3>
    <p>Straighten your smile discreetly with clear aligners. These virtually invisible trays gradually shift your teeth — perfect for teens and adults seeking an alternative to traditional braces.</p>

    <h3>✨ Dental Implants & Restorations</h3>
    <p>Missing teeth can impact function and confidence. Dental implants look, feel, and function like natural teeth, restoring both your smile and oral health.</p>

    <h3>✨ Gum Contouring</h3>
    <p>Gum contouring reshapes excessive gum tissue to improve smile balance and aesthetics — ideal for patients with a “gummy” smile.</p>
